Week 6 Workshop Quiz:
----------------------------------

Question 1
a) 
- An activity is defined as an application component which represents the entire screen. 
- A fragment on the other hand is defined as being part of a user interface of an activity. 
- While the host activity is running, a fragment can be added and removed. 
- Fragments also cannot exist independently of its activity but it has different a lifecycle to the activity which it is in. 


b)
Param 1: 
- Integer type
- It is the ID of the view container that holds the fragments that are about to be replaced.

Param 2:
- Fragment object value
- It represents the Fragment object which we want to place in the View container.

Param 3:
- String type value
- It is a unique tag which is used to identify transactions in a backstack. It can be used to keep track of the state of the back stack when we update it (i.e. popping off a transaction from the stack).

Question 2
a) 
- onCreateViewHolder will inflate the layout and return a ViewHolder object which is then passed to onBindViewHolder.
- onBindViewHolder is invoked once it receives the new ViewHolder object.
- Given the ViewHolder object and the position of the list item, onBindViewHolder is what will add data to our RecyclerView. 

b) 
- The purpose of the ViewHolder is for it to act as a container to store references to View objects that we want to display in the RecyclerView. 
- In the code snippet given, textView can be found in ViewHolder and can be used to store data to display on the RecyclerView.

Question 3
a)
- The Gson JAVA library enables us to convert Java objects to JSON format (and from JSON to Java objects).

b)
ArrayList<String> data;

SharedPreferences sp = getSharedPreferences("f1", 0);
String dataStr = sp.getString("KEY_GSON", "");
Type type = new TypeToken<ArrayList<String>>(){}.getType();
Gson gson = new Gson();
data = gson.fromJson(dataStr, type);

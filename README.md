# FIT2081 Mobile Application Development

## Description
These folders include my work completed across Week 3 to Week 10 of this unit. I believe this has decently met its initial learning 
objectives. By the end of the unit, students will have the following skills:

- Perform object oriented design and coding to create, test and debug non-trivial, working mobile applications that are maintainable and use the best practices of the development platform;
- Upload these applications to an appropriate marketplace;
- Describe the current software technologies and standards used in mobile application development;
- Describe the current platform and ecosystem landscape in the mobile application space.
